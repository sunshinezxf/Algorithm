# Regular Expression

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms to "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

## Patterns

The specific, standard textual syntax for representing patterns for matching text. Each characer in a regular expression is either a metacharacter, having a special meaning, or a regular character that has a literal meaning.

The simple way to specify a finite set of strings is to list its elements or members. In most formalisms, if there exists at least one regular expression that matches a particular set then there exists an infinite number of other regular expressions that also match it.

### Operations to Construct Regular Expressions

1. Boolean "or"

A vertical bar separates alternatives. For example, `gray|grey` can match "gray" or "grey".

2. Grouping

Parentheses are used to define the scope and precedence of the operators. For example, `gray|grey` and `gr(a|e)y` are equivalent patterns which both describe the set of "gray" or "grey".

3. Quantification

A quantifier after a token or group specifies how often that a preceding elements is allowed to occur. The most common quantifiers are the question mark `?`, the asterisk `*`, and the plus sign `+`.

| symbol | description |
|----|----|
|`?` | The question mark indicates zero or one occurences of the preceding elements. |
|`*` | The asterisk indicates zero or more occurrences of the preceding element. For example, ab\*c matches "ac", "abc", "abbc", "abbbc", and so on. |
|`+` | The plus sign indicates one or more occurrences of the preceding element. For example, ab+c matches "abc", "abbc", "abbbc", and so on, but not "ac". |
|`{n}` | The preceding item is matched exactly n times. |
|`{min, }` | The preceding item is matched min or more times. |
|`{min, max}` | The preceding item is matched at least min times, but not more than max times. |
|`.` | The wildcard `.` matches any character. For example, `a.b` matches any string that contains an "a", then any other character and then a "b", a.*b matches any string that contains an "a" and a "b" at some later point. |
|`^` | Matches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.|
|`[ ]` | A bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained within the brackets. For example, [abc] matches "a", "b", or "c". [a-z] specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from "a" to "z". These forms can be mixed: [abcx-z] matches "a", "b", "c", "x", "y", or "z", as does [a-cx-z]. The - character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first (after the ^, if present) character within the brackets: [abc-], [-abc]. Note that backslash escapes are not allowed. The ] character can be included in a bracket expression if it is the first (after the ^) character: []abc].| 
|`[^ ]`| Matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets. For example, [^abc] matches any character other than "a", "b", or "c". [^a-z] matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from "a" to "z". Likewise, literal characters and ranges can be mixed.|
|`$` | Matches the ending position of the string or the position just before a string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending position of any line. |
|`()` | Defines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry, \n). A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group.|
|`\n` | Matches what the nth marked subexpression matched, where n is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is vaguely defined in the POSIX.2 standard. Some tools allow referencing more than nine capturing groups.|

## Implementation Algorithms

### Thompson's Construction
Thompsion's construction algorithm is a method of transforming a reqular expression into an equivalent nondeterministic finite automation(NFA). This NFA can be used to match strings against the regular expression.

Regular expressions and nondeterministic finite automata are two representations of formal languages. For instance, text processing utilities use regular expressions to describe advanced search patterns, but NFAs are better suited for execution on a computer. Hence, this algorithm is of practical interest, since it can compile regular expressions into NFAs. From a theoretical point of view, this algorithm is a part of the proof that they both accept exactly the same languages, that is, the regular languages.


To decide whether two given regular expressions describe the same language, each can be converted into an equivalent minimal deterministic finite automaton via Thompson's construction, powerset construction, and DFA minimization. If, and only if, the resulting automata agree up to renaming of states, the regular expressions' languages agreed.

The algorithm works recursively by splitting an expression into its constituent subexpressions, from which the NFA will be constructed using a set of rules. More precisely, from a regular expression E, the obtained automaton A with the transition function δ respects the following properties:


+ A has exactly one initial state q0, which is not accessible from any other state. That is, for any state q and any letter a, {\displaystyle \delta (q,a)} \delta(q,a) does not contain q0.

+ A has exactly one final state qf, which is not co-accessible from any other state. That is, for any letter a, {\displaystyle \delta (q_{f},a)=\emptyset } \delta(q_f,a)=\emptyset.

+ Let c be the number of concatenation of the regular expression E and let s be the number of symbols apart from parentheses — that is, |, *, a and ε. Then, the number of states of A is 2s − c (linear in the size of E).

+ The number of transitions leaving any state is at most two.

+ Since an NFA of m states and at most e transitions from each state can match a string of length n in time O(emn), a Thompson NFA can do pattern matching in linear time, assuming a fixed-size alphabet.
